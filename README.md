# Reinforcement Learning Code Companion

This repository contains Python, MATLAB, and C++ implementations of various algorithms and concepts from the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide practical code examples corresponding to the theoretical concepts presented in each chapter of the book. This should serve as a resource for anyone looking to understand reinforcement learning algorithms through code.

## Contents

- `multi_armed_bandit.py`: Python implementation of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
- `MultiArmedBandit.m`: MATLAB implementation of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
- `multi_armed_bandit.cpp`: C++ implementation of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
- Additional files will be added corresponding to each chapter of the book.

## How to Use

Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific chapter and concept from the book. You can run each file independently to see the implementation of the respective algorithm or concept.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MATLAB (version info)
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
